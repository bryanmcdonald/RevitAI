# RevitAI Resources

Place the following icon files in this directory:

- `ChatIcon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for ribbon button (small)
- `ChatIcon32.png` - 32x32 pixel icon for ribbon button (large)

These icons are optional. The plugin will work without them, but the ribbon button will not have an icon.

## Recommended Icon Design

- Use a chat bubble or AI assistant icon
- Match Revit's icon style (flat, simple, professional)
- PNG format with transparency
- Light/dark variants if needed
